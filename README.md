# Nodejs with Typescript, sample project.

# About Repository:

This is a basic nodejs server that I created to learn how to set-up a nodejs project with typescript.

# Software(s) required:

* Latest stable version of Node Package Manager

# Project setup:

* Step 1:

Switch to the projects root directory and run ```yarn install``` to install the required packages.

* Step 2 (optional):

Run ```yarn build``` to generate JS files from the ts files, that will be placed in the dist folder.

* Step 3:

Run ```yarn dev``` to run the project or if `step 2` has been run you can start the project by running ```yarn start```.
